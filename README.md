Python Turtle graphics for Jupyter notebooks

For a quick demo, open
[the lab notebook](https://github.com/ramalho/jupyturtle/blob/main/notebooks/lab.ipynb).

To use on a local Jupyter Notebook, 
just download the `jupyturtle.py` file to the same folder where your notebook is saved,
and import it.

(I need more time to figure out how to deploy on Binder because Jupyturtle is not on conda forge yet

## Credits

The idea and some of the code for this module came from
[Tolga Atam](https://github.com/tolgaatam)'s
[ColabTurtle](https://github.com/tolgaatam/ColabTurtle/tree/master),
which I discovered reading a pre-print version of
[Allen Downey](https://github.com/allendowney)'s book
_[Think Python, Third Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/)_ (O'Reilly, 2024).


## Design

Atam's best idea was to use SVG for drawing, which makes the code simple and lightweight, 
requiring only the Python standard library and the
`ipython` module that is always available in Jupyter.

This is a rewrite from scratch, using classes to model the turtle
and the drawing.
My goal was to make it easier to understand and extend by
encapsulating the state.

I used metaprogramming techniques to build the procedural API
with global functions like `fd()` to move the turtle.
The techniques are easier to understand in the didactic project
[abacus](https://github.com/fluentpython/abacus).

### Turtle on a canvas

[`jupyturtle2`](https://github.com/fluentpython/jupyturtle2) is a fork
that uses 
[`ipycanvas`](https://ipycanvas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to draw pixels on an HTML canvas, instead of generating SVG,
so it handles complex drawings better.

But `jupyturtle2` has two main drawbacks:

* `ipycanvas` requires the binary dependencies `numpy` and `pillow`,
which may be harder to install in some environments.

* the generated drawings are not saved with the notebook like most other output cells; this is also a limitation of `ipycanvas`
